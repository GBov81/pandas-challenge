In conclusion, based on the dataset and subsequent analysis, charter schools perform better than district schools in both reading and math scores 
while spending less money on average per student. The gap in reading scores is almost 3% (2.94% more accurately) while the gap in math scores is 
more substantial at nearly 6 and half percent (6.42% to be exact). The charter schools also spend less of their budget on average per student (over $46 less). 
To be precise, the average cost for District schools is 642.63$, while the average cost for Charter schools is 596.58$. Charter schools also have a lower 
standard deviation in subject scores. The difference in reading scores is 8.94 for charter schools and 10.65 for district schools. While the difference in 
math scores is more significant at 9.22 for charter schools and 12.99 for district schools.

Possible reasons for these results:
Charter schools are less encumbered by labour agreements and regulation and can adapt and innovate more readily. Charter schools have greater control over 
which students can be admitted into their program, therefore can screen out students who may disrupt class and lower test scores. Also, since charter schools 
require admission selection and enrollment fees, it is reasonable to assume that there is greater parent engagement. Parents must be proactive in finding and 
selecting the charter school, going through the admission process and paying the annual fees. In addition, there are often performance-based and/or behavioural
contracts that students and parents must adhere to. All of these factors require greater parental interest and engagement. It has been long recognized that 
parental involvement is a very strong indicator of student success.
